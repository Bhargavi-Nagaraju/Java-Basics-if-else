# Java Basics â€“ if, if-else, if-else ladder,nested-if,switch-case

This repository contains 5 simple Java programs I created as part of my learning journey.  
The first two programs use **hardcoded values**, and the remaining use the **Scanner class** to take input from the user.

These programs cover fundamental Java concepts, including:
- Data types
- Variables
- Scanner for user input
- if, if-else, if-else ladder,nested-if
- Switch-case
